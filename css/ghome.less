/**
 * Command-line usage
 * 
 * Once installed (npm install -g less), you can invoke the compiler from the command-line, as such:
 * 
 * $ lessc styles.less
 * This will output the compiled CSS to stdout, you may then redirect it to a file of your choice:
 * 
 * $ lessc styles.less > styles.css
 * To output minified CSS, simply pass the -x option. If you would like more involved minification, 
 * the YUI CSS Compressor is also available with the --yui-compress option.
 * 
 * To see all the command line options run lessc without parameters.
 */

 /* .css files are not minified in a single file by the compiler. the @import directive will be 
  * left as is and generate an extra request to download the css file. */
